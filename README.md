Open Your Vscode
Make sure you have Local Server Enviroment Rather Xampp
Open a php file 
And write the codes in the file or open it and paste it to your vscode
When your done pasting it make sure your directory in the Xampp are in the htdocs
Then open a browser then type localhost/yourfolder/subdirectory
for me i have localhost/SA3/index.php
you can copy my directory if you want
i hope you enjoy!!
